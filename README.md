Sentiment analysis, the extraction of underlying meaning of reviews of positive and negative turns to one
of the most attractive tools for researchers and businesses. Recommendation system, is also becoming more and
more important in the marketing industry. Natural language processing, machine learning and neural network approaches
on large volumes of text, makes it possible to extract sentiments analysis and build recommendation system.
In this project we will build these two tools based on European hotel reviews.
